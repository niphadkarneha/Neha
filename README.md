# Hello, World ðŸ˜€

I'm a Data Analyst at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/n/nniph001) working for the Department of Academic Affairs in Norfolk, Virginia. I stumble into coding ever so often. I studied Computer Science at [Tidewater Community College](https://www.tcc.edu) and [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/compsci).

My resume is available if you want to be all formal and the usual stuff â¬‡. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niphad/)

Also, I'd like you to meet Leo, little 10 pound monster who keeps me on my toes <img src="./leo.jpg" width="200" height="450">
