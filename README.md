# Hello, World ðŸ˜€

I'm a Data Enthusiast at [MAP Communications, Inc](https://www.mapcommunications.com) in Virginia. I stumble into coding ever so often. I studied Computer Science at Tidewater Community College and Old Dominion University.

I love traveling, reading, taking photos, and musicals (Bollywood Buff). I'm learning how to play a guitar and a keyboard. My resume is available if you want to be all formal and the usual stuff â¬‡

Also, I'd like you to meet Leo, little 10 pound monster who keeps me on my toes <img src="./leo.jpg" width="700" height="850">
